## Approach

- For this project, let's use IMDB dataset of movie reviews and generate search results of review.
- Our problem seeks a similarity function for given text against dataset (all reviews). This problem is called as `Nearest Neighbour Search` problem (latest version of ElasticSearch has already implemented Nearest Neighbour Search)
- For vectorizer, let's use Google\Tensorflow's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) with 512 dimensions.

## Requirements

- ElasticSearch database installed and running.
- Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model downloaded locally - <https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5>
- Installs:  
`pip3 install --upgrade pip`  
`pip3 install elasticsearch`  
`pip3 install pandas`  
`pip3 install --upgrade --no-cache-dir tensorflow`  
`pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-hub`  

## Results

`NOTE: Results depend on # of samples in dataset, current project could be improved with some pre-processing of text`

Search Text = 'psychological thriller is what i like'

Results:

{'percentage_match': 67, 'text': 'Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk\'s Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle'}
