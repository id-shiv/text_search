## Approach

- For this project, let's use IMDB dataset of movie reviews and generate search results of review.
- Our problem seeks a similarity function for given text against dataset (all reviews). This problem is called as `Nearest Neighbour Search` problem (latest version of ElasticSearch has already implemented Nearest Neighbour Search)
- For vectorizer, let's use Google\Tensorflow's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) with 512 dimensions.

## Requirements

- ElasticSearch database installed and running.
- Installs:
`pip3 install --upgrade pip`
`pip3 install elasticsearch`
`pip3 install pandas`
`pip3 install --upgrade --no-cache-dir tensorflow`
`pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-hub`
